## TASK ONE - GPA CALCULATOR
This task involves building a Simple GPA Calculator, which is use for calculating Student's Grade Point Average(GPA).
The program employs a simple grading system and allows users to input information for multiple courses, including the course name, code, unit, and score.
Upon execution, the program provides a welcoming message and prompts the user to input the number of courses they wish to evaluate.
The program then processes this information and displays the GPA result in a clear and organized tabular format.
